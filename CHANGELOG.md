# Changelog

All notable changes to Yon are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and Yon adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **SSH jump host per Environment** ([#21]). An Environment can define an SSH
  jump host; when it is active, Yon dials every Request through one in-process
  SSH Tunnel (`golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`) — the URL is never rewritten.
  - Environment manager gains an *SSH jump host* section: host / port / user,
    private-key (path + passphrase) or password auth, and a *Skip host key
    check* toggle. Passphrase and password are stored as Secrets in the
    gitignored `.env`, never in the committed Collection.
  - **Tunnels window** (`Collection ▸ Tunnels…`): a live table of every Tunnel
    (state, refcount, uptime, last error) with a Disconnect button; the next
    send reconnects automatically.
  - **Footer indicator** beside the version: a coloured dot and the active
    environment's name when a jump host is configured; click it to open the
    Tunnels window.
  - **Host-key verification (trust on first use):** an unknown host shows a
    fingerprint confirmation, and a changed key on a known host is hard-rejected.
    Yon reads `~/.ssh/known_hosts` read-only and never writes to it.

### Notes
- Jump-host fields are resolved against the active Environment's variables; an
  incomplete config (an unresolved `{{var}}`) never dials.
- The HTTP proxy is bypassed while a jump host is active.
- No external `ssh` binary is required — Yon stays a single download.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Reorder requests by drag & drop** — drag a request in the sidebar to
  reorder it, drop it onto a folder to move it in, or onto a top-level row to
  move it out. (Drag is paused while a sidebar filter is active.)
- The app **version** now shows at the far left of the bottom status bar.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Filter requests** — a sidebar search box filters requests as you type
  (name, method, or URL). Folders containing a match expand; non-matching
  folders are hidden. Clearing the box restores the full list.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Folders** — organize a collection's requests into one level of folders,
  collapse/expand to hide them. New Folder button; right-click a request →
  *Move to folder…*; right-click a folder → *Rename* / *Delete* (deleting a
  folder keeps its requests, moving them back to top level). Collapse state is
  saved with the collection.
- **Duplicate a request** — right-click → *Duplicate* (an independent copy
  inserted right after the original).

### Changed
- The response **Headers** moved into a tab, so the **Body** now uses the full
  pane (Body | Headers tabs).

## [0.10.5] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Clicking a request in the sidebar opens it again** — fixes a v0.10.4
  regression where left-click no longer opened a request as a tab (right-click →
  Delete was unaffected).

### Internal
- Release builds retry asset uploads (absorbing transient GitHub API timeouts)
  and no longer use a deprecated GitHub Action.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Delete a request** — right-click a request in the sidebar → *Delete* (with
  confirmation). Open tabs and selection stay consistent.

### Fixed
- **Session restore** now works when you quit by closing the window (not just
  Cmd/Ctrl+Q): reopening Yon brings back your last collection and its open tabs.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Rename Collection** prefills the dialog with the current name (previously
  blank for name-less files, which felt like creating a new collection); the
  confirm button reads *Rename*.
- The **status bar** shows just the path of a resolved URL even when the
  `{{server}}` value has no scheme (e.g. `host:port/usage` → `/usage`).

### Internal
- Releases stay a **draft until all platform binaries are uploaded**, then
  auto-publish — so the in-app *Check for Updates* never offers a version whose
  download isn't ready yet.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Rename a collection** — *Collection ▸ Rename Collection…* sets the
  collection's own name (window title and sidebar header), independent of the
  file name. Clearing it falls back to the file name.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Save shortcuts** — Cmd/Ctrl+S saves the collection, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S is
  Save As (they work even while a text field is focused).
- **Check for Updates** shows a "Checking for updates…" progress indicator.

### Fixed
- **Secret variables** resolve to their value (they were resolving to empty —
  e.g. a blank `token=` in the built request / cURL).
- The **status bar** shows the real path with `{{variables}}` resolved, not the
  literal `{{key}}`.
- The **macOS build** registers the `.yon` file type, so double-clicking a
  collection opens it in Yon.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **URL ⇄ Params live sync** — pasting a URL with a `?query` fills the **Params**
  table; editing the table rewrites the URL; unchecking a row drops it from the
  URL while keeping it in the table. Special characters round-trip safely and
  `{{templates}}` stay readable.
- **Double-click to open** a `.yon` collection from Finder / Explorer / your
  file manager (register the file type with the scripts in `packaging/`).

### Fixed
- **Copy as cURL** expands `{{variables}}` from the active environment and no
  longer mangles unresolved templates into `%7B%7B…`.
- The collection header no longer shows *Untitled* for a name-less `.yon` opened
  from disk — it falls back to the file name.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- The **About Yon** dialog shows the Thai name **(โยน)** under the Yon title.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- After an in-app update downloads, Yon asks before installing: **Open & Quit**
  opens the downloaded installer and quits Yon, or **Later** just reveals the
  file (you can't replace a running app while it's open).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- The **macOS download is now a drag-to-install `.dmg`** that mounts showing
  Yon.app next to an Applications shortcut (still a universal binary).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Update check on macOS** reported "development build" because the released
  macOS binary didn't carry its version. The version is now embedded from
  `FyneApp.toml` so every build/platform reports it correctly.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Environments & variables** — define `{{variables}}` in named environments
  (Local / Prod…) and at the collection level, switch the active environment
  from a toolbar selector, and reference them in the URL, query params, headers,
  body and auth.
- **Secrets stay out of committed files** — secret values live in a gitignored
  `.env`, blanked in committed environment files, never in the `.yon`.
- Dynamic values: `{{$uuid}}`, `{{$timestamp}}`, `{{$isoTimestamp}}`,
  `{{$randomInt}}`.

### Changed
- **Redesigned request tabs** — browser-style cards with coloured method chips,
  a dirty dot, per-tab close, and horizontal overflow scrolling. Cmd/Ctrl+W
  closes the active tab; the method dropdown is wider.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **More HTTP methods** — PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, plus any custom verb you type.
- **XML support** — a dedicated XML request body (auto `application/xml` + a
  Format button) and a response viewer that pretty-prints and syntax-highlights
  XML and HTML (in addition to JSON), preserving comments, namespaces and
  mixed-content whitespace.
- Test server gained `/xml`, `/html` and `/soap` endpoints with matching
  requests in `testserver.yon`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Import Collection (JSON)** — *File ▸ Import Collection (JSON)…* brings in
  requests from a Collection v2.1 JSON export; anything Yon can't represent is
  reported in a summary.

### Fixed
- Transparent app-icon corners (no more white corners on the rounded icon).
- **macOS menus** — *About* and *Settings…* live in the application (Yon) menu;
  no more duplicate app menu.
- Dev/un-packaged builds no longer claim to be out of date in the update check.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **About Yon** — a *Yon ▸ About Yon* dialog showing the app icon, version,
  slogan, a short description, a source link, and the licence.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Update checker (opt-in)** — *Check for Updates…* queries GitHub for a newer
  release and, if one exists, downloads the build for your OS to Downloads and
  reveals it. A Settings toggle adds an **off-by-default** startup check, keeping
  the offline / no-telemetry promise.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Text search in responses (Cmd/Ctrl+F)** — find a string in the response body
  with match highlighting, an *n/m* counter, prev/next navigation, and Esc to
  close. Works in the main and pop-out windows.
- **Pop-out response window** (⤢) — view a large response in its own resizable
  window; drag-select & copy, *Save Output As…*, and Cmd/Ctrl+F search.
- **Edit menu** — Copy / Paste / Find… from the menu bar.

### Internal
- CI: bumped `actions/checkout` → v5 and `actions/setup-go` → v6 (Node 24).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Native OS file dialogs** — Open / Save As / Save-response use the native
  Finder / Explorer / GTK dialog (falls back to the in-app dialog if
  unavailable).
- **Copy as cURL** — generate the equivalent `curl` command for any request.
- **Save / Save As buttons** in the sidebar toolbar.
- Bundled HTTP **test server** (`testserver/`) and a ready-made collection.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Initial release of Yon — an offline desktop client for testing HTTP APIs.
  Build requests (method, URL, params, headers, auth, body), send them, and view
  the response; save and reopen Collections as human-readable `.yon` files.
  Native builds for macOS (universal), Windows, and Linux.
